# Output Examples

This folder contains examples of the main output files generated by the pipeline. Each file here corresponds to a step of the HMM construction, evaluation, and comparison workflow. Below is a description of their roles and how they are produced.

## File List and Descriptions

### `neg_1.fasta` and `neg_2.fasta`
These FASTA files contain the sequences of **non-Kunitz proteins** used respectively in **test set 1** and **test set 2**. They are sampled from Swiss-Prot after removing any sequences too similar to the Kunitz representatives (based on CD-HIT clustering).

---

### `pos_1.fasta` and `pos_2.fasta`
These contain the sequences of **Kunitz domain proteins** selected for use in **test set 1** and **test set 2**, respectively. They are randomly selected from the pool of cleaned Kunitz sequences not used in model training.

---

### `pdb_kunitz_rp_clean.fasta`
This file contains the **cleaned representative Kunitz sequences**, i.e., the subset of PDB-derived Kunitz proteins that passed filters on length and structural quality. This is the set used for generating both the structural and sequence-based multiple alignments.

---

### `pdb_kunitz_rp_strali.fasta` and `pdb_kunitz_rp_strali.hmm`
- `.fasta`: The multiple alignment file produced via **PDBeFold** structural alignment.
- `.hmm`: The **HMM model** built using the structural alignment as input.

---

### `pdb_kunitz_rp_seqali.fasta` and `pdb_kunitz_rp_seqali.hmm`
- `.fasta`: The multiple sequence alignment of the same representatives, but aligned using **MUSCLE**.
- `.hmm`: The **HMM model** built from this sequence-based alignment.

> Files ending in `_strali` refer to structural alignment-based processing, while those ending in `_seqali` are based on sequence alignment (see point 5 of the main README).

---

### `set_1_strali.class` and `set_2_strali.class`
These are the results of `hmmsearch` using the **structural HMM** on **set 1** and **set 2** respectively. These files are used during **cross-validation**: for example, the best threshold from Set 1 is used to evaluate performance on Set 2.

---

### `temp_overall_strali.class`
This file contains results of `hmmsearch` on a **combined dataset** of Kunitz and non-Kunitz sequences (from both sets). It provides a **global evaluation** of model performance under more realistic and extensive testing conditions, beyond the two-fold CV.

> An equivalent file exists for the sequence-based model as well (`temp_overall_seqali.class`), generated when running `create_hmm_seq.sh`.

---

### `hmm_results_strali.txt` and `hmm_results_seqali.txt`
These are the final **performance summary reports**:
- They list the best E-value thresholds selected by maximizing **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**.
- Metrics include **Q2**, **MCC**, **True Positive Rate (TPR)**, and **Precision (PPV)**.
- Also lists **false positives and false negatives**.
- These results allow comparison between structural and sequence-based model performance.

## Notes

- All `*_strali*` files are generated using the **structural alignment-based HMM**.
- All `*_seqali*` files are generated using the **sequence alignment-based HMM** (optional step described in section 5 of the main README).

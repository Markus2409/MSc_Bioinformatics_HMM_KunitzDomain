Here there are all the projects that i have done during my studies in MSc Bioinformatics at University of Bologna (UNIBO)

Here some commands to use git-hub
first of all the folder that you have chosen is shared between your pc and git-hub website. If you create a file into your pc, to save modified processes you have to go into github icon![alt text](image.png)
Here you have to commit saves, and after that PUSH! to sync online the modified that you have done. 
Indeed if you want to download updated version of the file into your pc you have to press PULL!
If you want to copy your github folder indeed CLONE is the command that makes for you!

Enjoy!
